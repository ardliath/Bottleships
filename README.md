# Bottleships

### What Is BottleShips
Bottleships is the 4th iteration of BotWars, a team building event I've run where developers complete against each other to prove their superior programming skills. For more information see [BotWars](https://github.com/davidseanlittlewood/BeatTheBotsServer) and [BotWars2](https://github.com/ardliath/BotWars2) (I didn't develop BotWars3, I got to play).

This year the game is based on the game of Battleships, with each team creating an AI which competes against the others to prove it is the best admiral of the virtual seas.

The game is very much in the early versions:

However I'm hoping to run this event in Q1 (or maybe Q2) and so hope to have a working version developed by then.

### How Can I Help?
Take a look at the [Issues Page](https://github.com/ardliath/Bottleships/issues) where I'm adding details of what I'm working on next.

### Can I Play Bottleships at my Company/With My Friends?
Of course! The game is under the MIT Licence, I'd recommend you wait until it's finished first though!
